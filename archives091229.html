	<h2>29 Dec 09</h2>
	<p class="block">At the end of November, our base held its annual fundraiser event for our warehouse building project. Despite the 115 degree heat inside and out, we had a great turn out of around 250 guests. We also saw about $46,000 come in which will go straight into building our cafe and the auditorium, which we need to have completed by April because we are hosting a YWAM National Leader's Meeting in May.</p>
	<p class="block"><strong>Shawn-</strong> My band, Like Moths, has been working our bunz off, writing lots of new material, recording, and we've had the opportunity to play a few times around Newcastle at events and in schools. We've had the chance to personally connect with heaps of young people and have even seen some of them come to Youth Street because of it. The humble beginnings are feeling really exciting and promising. We've just completed our application as a performance team for the YWAM Australia and PNG ship tour and can't wait to get out there and do our stuff and see what God does through it.</p>
	<p class="block"><strong>Sarah-</strong> This past month has been my busiest one yet in the nearly 3 years that I've been here. The school year wrapped up in mid-December, so that aspect of ministry is on hold for the time being. I was leading the Youth Street department for nearly a month and learned a whole lot during that time. We were in the midst of running an event called The Rage which purposes to see new Youth Street kids coming on Saturdays. It was quite challenging to get our crew that have been coming to understand the reason to bring their friends and the importance of doing so. Needless to say, I think that God has given a fair bit of vision to some of us about how to constantly keep things dynamic and up to speed with what's cool in youth culture. We're constantly needing to be cutting edge to keep our kids involved. My focus is now turning more fully to the upcoming Ship Tour and the in's and out's of what will be going on while the ship is actually in Newcastle.</p>
	<p class="block">We celebrated our first Christmas together as a married couple! It was a lot of fun and we spent a majority of the time with our "Base" family, playing games, eating lots of food, and just spending time together. We had about 4 days off of work and it was a much needed break. As we head into 2010 it's looking to be a very busy year, but heaps exciting at the same time. Stay tuned for what's on the horizon for the Cothrans!!!</p>
