	<h3>Your Chance to Help!</h3>

	<p class="block">We have a huge need. I (Sarah) am coordinating our base's work in the Newcastle portion of the YWAM Australia & Papua New Guinea ship tour 2010. I (Shawn) am leading our evangelistic band, Like Moths, on the tour. The ship will travel the eastern and southern coasts of AUS and then to PNG (our closest international neighbor). The two main purposes are 1) to mobilize 100,000 youth into missions and 2) to provide health care to the people of Papua New Guinea. PNG has major gaps in health care services for their people. There are rising rates of HIV, deaths from curable diseases, cataracts, poor sanitation for labor and delivery, the list goes on. The ship's equipped with all the facilities, trained doctors and staff needed to provide surgeries, education and medicine to the people of PNG.</p>

<p class="block">Last week we strongly felt the Lord call us to GO to PNG to experience and gain authority in what is going on, meet & serve the people and gain God's heart for them. It's not terribly convenient for us from a practical point of view, due to our other responsibilities and roles, but God has continued to affirm what He's spoken and we firmly believe in being radically obedient when God says to go. So... here we go! After all, that's what Jesus did.</p>

<p class="block">So here we are, Shawn and Sarah, headed to Papua New Guinea for around 10 days. We're trying to head out November 29 or 30 and we need your help!</p>

<p class="block">Would you pray for ALL the finances to be provided in the next 8 days and even pray about giving financially? There's no exact figure yet, but our food and accommodation will be $14 daily. Travel costs are around $4,000. When you invest in our mission, it becomes yours too. You will be GOING with us. You are a part of the Great Commission and will be in Papua New Guinea serving the people with us!</p>
